A **factory readiness + CapEx governance** portfolio project: readiness gating, critical-path visibility, CapEx variance tracking, expedite burn analysis, and automated **leadership-ready evidence packs** generated in CI.

> **All data is synthetic/anonymized**.

## Why this exists (what it demonstrates)
This repo is intentionally designed to show **execution discipline + decision-making** across **CapEx + facilities readiness + supply chain**:

- Clear “what’s blocking install/power-on?” visibility
- Early identification of gate slip risk (open/blocked/high-risk work)
- CapEx variance + forecast drift surfaced by program / category / month
- Expedite burn tracking by vendor and driver
- Repeatable “evidence pack” outputs you can share with leadership

---

## What questions the dashboard answers
- What’s on the **critical path** right now (per program/tool)?
- What’s **blocking** install → power-on → commissioning → SAT?
- Where are we burning **expedite**, and which vendors drive it?
- Which gates are most likely to **slip**, and why?
- Where is CapEx trending vs plan/forecast (what’s driving variance)?

---

## Key results (from the included synthetic dataset)
### Dataset scale
- CapEx plan vs actuals: **3,600 rows** (program × tool × category × month)
- Facility readiness tasks: **900 tasks** (dependencies + gates + risk)
- Lead-time / expedite lines: **4,200 rows** (need-by vs promise vs received + expedite spend)
- Coverage: **5 programs**, **50 tools**, **6 categories**, **6 vendors**, **24 months**

### Example insights you can demo (synthetic)
- Planned CapEx: **$561.8M** vs Actual: **$569.3M** → **+$7.5M variance**
- Expedite spend: **$7.6M** across **1,434 expedited lines**
- Readiness spread: **~57.5% → ~87.0%** across tools with multiple **R/A** flags

> These numbers are computed from the synthetic CSVs checked into `data/raw/`.

---

## What’s included
### 1) Streamlit dashboard
- Entry point: `app.py`
- Reads from: `data/raw/` (synthetic CSVs)

### 2) Analytics modules (reusable program logic)
- `src/analytics/readiness.py` — readiness rollups + RAG
- `src/analytics/critical_path.py` — dependency-aware critical path per tool/program
- `src/analytics/expedite.py` — vendor burn summaries

### 3) Evidence pack (auto-generated + CI artifact)
Generated by:
- `python -m src.tooling.generate_evidence`

Written to:
- `docs/evidence/`

Outputs:
- `docs/evidence/readiness_score_output.md`
- `docs/evidence/critical_path_output.md`
- `docs/evidence/expedite_summary_output.md`
- `docs/evidence/capex_variance_snapshot.md`
- `docs/evidence/gate_slip_risk_output.md`

---

## How to run locally
### Prereqs
- Python **3.11+**

### Setup
```bash
python -m venv .venv
# Windows:
# .\.venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux:
# source .venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the dashboard
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### Generate evidence pack
```bash
python -m src.tooling.generate_evidence
```

---

## CI / Automation
### GitHub Actions — “capex-readiness-ci”
Workflow file:
- `.github/workflows/capex_readiness_ci.yml`

What it does:
- Installs dependencies
- Runs `python -m src.tooling.generate_evidence`
- Uploads `docs/evidence/**` as a CI artifact

---

## Data model (synthetic)
Raw inputs:
- `data/raw/capex_plan_vs_actuals.csv`
- `data/raw/facility_readiness_tasks.csv`
- `data/raw/lead_times_expedite.csv`

Optional rollups (if you add them later):
- `data/processed/`

Data dictionary:
- `docs/data_dictionary/`

---

## Program management artifacts (TPM-style)
### Templates
- `docs/templates/DECISION_LOG_TEMPLATE.md`
- `docs/templates/RAID_LOG_TEMPLATE.md`
- `docs/templates/WEEKLY_EXEC_UPDATE_TEMPLATE.md`

### Samples
- `docs/samples/DECISION_LOG_SAMPLE.md`
- `docs/samples/RAID_LOG_SAMPLE.md`

## How to adapt this to real work (safely)
- Keep the logic, **swap the data** (never publish proprietary CapEx, vendor, or facility data)
- Replace identifiers with anonymized keys (Program A/B/C, Vendor 1/2/3)
- Prefer aggregated metrics over raw transactional exports

---

## Roadmap (optional next upgrades)
- Add scenario planning (forecast vs commit vs stretch)
- Add “gate readiness” go/no-go criteria checks per milestone
- Add a KPI page: OTD, lead time percentiles, expedite rate, variance aging
- Add tests for schema validation on input CSVs
