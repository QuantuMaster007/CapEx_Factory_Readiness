# Weekly Exec Update — CapEx + Factory Readiness

**Week of:** 2026-01-02  
**Program(s):** Phoenix-ETD, Orion-Ramp  
**Owner:** Sourabh Tarodekar  

## 1) Summary
- Readiness is **at risk** for multiple tools due to **Install-gate blockers** (power drops + exhaust hookups).
- Expedite burn concentrated in **Supplier expedite + Air freight**, primarily VendorB/VendorD.
- CapEx variance trending positive in Facilities + TestEquipment; propose **rebaseline** after Install gate clears.

## 2) Key Decisions Needed
- **Decision:** Approve temporary exhaust workaround for Bay-3 (to avoid SAT slip)  
  **By when:** 2026-01-05  
  **Options:** (A) Temporary ducting + EHS signoff (B) wait for permanent hookup  
  **Recommendation:** A, with timeboxed controls + final hookup plan.

## 3) Critical Path (example)
